        <p>First-person shooter (FPS) with 5v5 multiplayer where one team assaults and the other defends. Search and Destroy, the primary game mode, is extremely similar to CS:GO. While the opposing team works to prevent it, the attacking side's objective is to place a bomb (referred to as a spike) and have it explode. Whether or whether the spike is planted, the opposing squad will win if a squad is eliminated before any other victory criteria are satisfied. Each round of a match lasts 100 seconds, and there are 25 total rounds. The match is won by the first team reaching 13 victories. You will have 30 seconds to purchase weapons and equipment for that round at the beginning of the session.You will need to wait until the following round to respawn if you die during a round. There are two types of matches available for this main game mode: ranked and unranked. It sounds exactly like the Defuse game style in CS:GO, but Riot has added a new twist. You'll pick an Agent at the start of each round in addition to purchasing weaponry. Each Agent has a special skill that can do anything from heal teammates to create barriers out of thin air. You'll probably need a good variety of skills if you want to win a match in Valorant because it bases Agents on a MOBA. However, keep in mind that some skills must be purchased at the start of a game. The Spike Rush game mode has been introduced to Valorant since its debut.</p>
